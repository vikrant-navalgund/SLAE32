GOST 64-bit Symmetric Block Cipher Implementation

Block Cipher Implementation file:
    - GOST_28147-89.py

Helper utilities:
    - GOST-keygen.py - generate a random 32 byte key
    - GOST-txt2byte.py - convert a utf-8 text file to byte buffer for encryption

Dependencies:
    - pip install -r requirements.txt
        - art
        - fixedint

Caveats:
    - Input Key has to be in binary/byte buffer - use the GOST-keygen.py to generate one.
    - Input buffer should be in binary/byte buffer - use the GOST-txt2byte.py for conversion.
    - Any data in binary/byte buffer like shellcode etc.. should be good to go.
